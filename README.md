<ul>
  <li>Implemented an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers.</li>
  <li>Used a dataset with features such as throughput and latency to train the algorithm.</li>
  <li>Fitted a Gaussian distribution to the dataset to estimate parameters (mean and variance) for each feature.</li>
  <li>Selected the best threshold based on a cross-validation set using the F1 score.</li>
  <li>Identified outliers in the dataset by comparing the probability of examples with the selected threshold.</li>
</ul>
